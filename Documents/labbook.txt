- used GEO2R with standard parameters to analyse and download the following GSEs:
	- GSE68801: AA
	- GSE137268: Asthma
	- GSE130499: Asthma
	=> resulting in the three tsv files in the Material folder
- used the R-script to sort by padj. and only keep entries with padj <0.05 and |logFC|>= 0.58
	=> resulting excel files in the Results folder
- used the gene symbols as inputs in venny

06.01.2025
- accessed GEO2R using a VPN and a private tab
- For GSE68801 the case control are: 23/36 if for the case the ones with AU (Alopecia universalis)
- As for the R code:
# group membership for all samples
gsms <- paste0("XXXXXX1X0000XXXXXX11X110000XXXXXXX10000XXXXXXX1100",
        "00XXXXXXXX1110000XXXXXXX11X1000XXXXXXX111100000000",
        "XXXXXXXX111X110000XXX0")
sml <- strsplit(gsms, split="")[[1]]

# filter out excluded samples (marked as "X")
sel <- which(sml != "X")
sml <- sml[sel]
gset <- gset[ ,sel]

=> now there finally are a lot of results that have an adj.p.val of <0.05

- For GSE137268 the case/control are: 12/15 with the case ones being severe asthma  
- For GSE130499 the case/control are: 44/38 with the case ones being severe asthma  
- resulting venny in Results/select samples

08.01.2025
- instead of for examples comparing the control group with all asthma groups here I compared the control with the subgroups of the disease
- for that i used GEO2R, selected control and only for example severe asthma (SA) and ran it
- I downloaded the full tables and filtered the data with adj.p.val <=0.05 and |logFC| >=0.58
- the results are in the results.xlsx file in the results folder

18.01.2025
- GSE68801 A.A. transcriptome data set GEO2R analysis 
	- only discovery data
	- case: AAP (A.A. patchy), AT (A. totalis), AU (A. universalis)
	- only lesional AAP
	- only lesional AU (which they all are)
	- no AAP.T (transient patchy type disease)
	- control: All normal spamples
   => case:control = 37:23 with 62 unused samples
   => GSE68801.18.01.25.tsv
- GSE130499 Asthma transcriptome data set has three types of data: SA, M-MA, NC
	- For GSE130499 the case/control are: 44/38 with the case ones being severe asthma (SA)
		=> GSE130499_SA.tsv
	- For GSE130499 the case/control are: 72/38 with the case ones being mild-moderate asthma (M-MA)
		=> GSE130499_M-MA.tsv
	- For GSE130499 the case/control are: with the case ones being M-MA AND SA 
		=> GSE130499.top.table.tsv
- filtered all 4 tables with adj.p.val <=0.05 and |logFC| >=0.58
- Venny using those 4 filtered tables
	=> Venny_18.01.25.png in the results folder
=> RESULTS
- 1 is present in all 4: IFRD1
- 3 are present in all 3 asthma: CELA2A, TFF3, CELA2B
- 5 are present in SA + M-MA: ZNF331, CREM, ERRFI1, OSM, CXADR
- 2 are present in M-MA + "Both": SCGB1A1, SCGB3A1

GEO2R
- GSE245608: skin tape stips: 
This data was sequenced with RNA-seq and not array so GEO2R is not the best choice for analysing but rather DE-seq2.
There is an in-beta version that can analyse RNA-seq data in GEO2R, which i am gonna use now and then try to do this DEG Analysis with DE-seq2 afterwards to compare the results.
	- control: 12
	- case: 11 samples MAA = moderate allergic asthma
	=> GSE245608.MAA.tsv

	- control: 12
	- case: 7 samlples SAA = severe allergic asthma
	=> GSE245608.SAA.tsv

	- control: 12
	- case: 18 samples SAA + MAA
	=> GSE245608.All.tsv

19.02.2025
GSE161245 is a RNA-seq dataset as well as GSE245608 with the difference being that GEO2R works with the latter but not the first for some reason.
	=> DESeq2 will be needed

- filtered DEGs of GSE245608 files with padj <=0.05 and |log2FoldChange| >=0.58
	- yes, the metrics are called different when analysed with the beta GEO2R tool for RNA-seq data 

25.02.2025
- using a DESeq script for DEG analysis of RNA-seq transciptome data
	=> R/DESeq2/DESeq2-pipeline.R
- GSE245608 is a RNA-seq dataset that I was previously able to analyse using GEO2R. Lets compare the results of my and the GEO2R pipeline
